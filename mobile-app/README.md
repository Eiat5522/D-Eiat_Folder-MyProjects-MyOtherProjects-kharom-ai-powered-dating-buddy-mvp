### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
-   npm or yarn
-   Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
-   An iOS device with the Expo Go app installed for previewing.
-   Ensure your development machine and your iOS device are on the **same Wi-Fi network** for reliable Expo Go connection.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Navigate to the `mobile-app` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mobile-app
    # (If you are in the project root)
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    # yarn start
    # or
    # expo start
    ```

4.  **Open in Expo Go:**
    -   Once the Metro Bundler starts, you will see a QR code in the terminal.
    -   Open the Expo Go app on your iOS device and scan the QR code.
    -   Alternatively, if you have an Expo account and are logged in on both your CLI and Expo Go, the project might appear automatically in the "Recently in Development" section of Expo Go.
