# Project Progress

## Current Status: AI Provider Switched to OpenRouter, Initial Testing Done
- **Overall:** KhaRom MVP Phase 0 & 1 complete. Phase 2 (Core Chat UI & Logic) is largely complete. AI Provider switched from Google Gemini to OpenRouter. Tailwind CSS issues in `api-server` resolved. Playwright tests removed.
- **`mobile-app` successfully upgraded to Expo SDK 53.**
- **`react-native-safe-area-context`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated`, `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` successfully integrated.**
- **Core chat flow is functional in Expo Go with OpenRouter backend.**
- **Task 2.1, 2.2 (updated with detailed feedback), 2.3, 2.4 are complete.**
- **OpenRouter integration in `api-server` complete.**
- **Manual `curl` testing of the OpenRouter API endpoint is successful.**
- **Successfully scraped Scribd document for training data.**
- **Phase 3 (Localization) complete, including language toggle in drawer (Task 3.4).**
- **Phase 4 (UX Feedback Mechanisms - thumbs-up/down with details, retry, localized errors) complete.**
- **Chat UI Order Corrected (2025-05-11):** Message prepending implemented in `ChatScreen.tsx` for correct visual order with `inverted` FlatList.
- **User Testing (Initial):** User has tested Phase 3.4 and Phase 4 features and confirmed functionality.
- **Default Model Updated:** Default OpenRouter model changed to `qwen/qwen2-7b-instruct` (or user-specified ID) in local and Vercel environments.
- **Session-Based Chat History (Phase C) Implemented (2025-05-11):** Core logic for creating, saving, loading, viewing, renaming, and deleting chat sessions is complete. This includes AsyncStorage persistence, `SessionContext` for state management, `ChatHistoryScreen` UI with swipe actions, and `ChatScreen` integration.
- **Current Focus:** Expanded Phase 5 - Testing & Refinement of all features including chat history.

## What Works
-   **Project Definition:** Clear understanding of MVP scope.
-   **Core Documentation:** Memory Bank and `cline_docs` established and updated.
-   **Version Control:** Git setup.
-   **Mobile App Foundation (SDK 53):**
    -   Expo SDK 53 project scaffolded and previewable.
    -   ESLint and Prettier configured.
    -   Core dependencies installed.
    -   **Chat functionality:** Core UI and logic for sending/receiving messages, loading/error states.
    -   **Localization:** Full setup complete. UI language can be toggled (EN/TH) via drawer. All relevant UI text (including for chat history) is translated.
    -   **Navigation:** Drawer navigation implemented, including access to Chat History.
    -   **UX Feedback:** Thumbs-up/down with detailed feedback collection via bottom sheet is functional. Retry mechanism for errors is in place. Error messages are localized. Feedback is persisted within chat sessions.
    -   **Session Management & Chat History:**
        -   Sessions are stored locally using `AsyncStorage` (`SessionStorageService.ts`).
        -   `SessionContext.tsx` manages active session, list of summaries, and CRUD operations.
        -   `ChatHistoryScreen.tsx` displays session summaries with swipe-to-reveal rename/delete actions and a FAB for new chats.
        -   `ChatScreen.tsx` is session-aware: loads messages from, and saves new messages to, the active session. Automatically creates a new session if none is active on load.
        -   Custom chat titles persist after new messages (using hasCustomTitle flag).
        -   Chat History displays items in clean two-line format:
            * Line 1: Chat snippet (if not renamed) or custom title (if renamed)
            * Line 2: "Last updated" timestamp
-   **API Server Foundation (Updated for OpenRouter):**
    -   Working OpenRouter integration.
    -   "Thai Dating Guru" system prompt.
    -   Secure environment variable management.
    -   Error handling.
-   Deployed to Vercel and functional.
