# Project Progress

## Current Status: Project Initialization (As of 2025-05-09)
- **Overall:** The KhaRom MVP project has just been initiated.
- **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with initial project information.
- **Codebase:** No application code has been written yet. Project structure setup is the immediate next step.
- **Knowledge Graph:** Not yet initialized. This will be done after memory bank file creation.

## What Works
-   **Project Definition:** Clear understanding of MVP scope, core features, target users, and technical constraints based on `projectbrief.md` and `.clinerules/clinerules.md`.
-   **Initial Documentation:** The foundational memory bank is in place.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level MVP Goals)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Setup
-   [ ] Initialize Git repository on GitHub.
-   [ ] Set up React Native (Expo Bare) project structure.
-   [ ] Set up Next.js API project structure.
-   [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier for both projects.
-   [ ] Initialize Knowledge Graph with core entities.

### Phase 2: Core Chat Functionality (React Native App)
-   [ ] Implement basic UI for Chat Screen (Message Input, Message List).
-   [ ] Develop `MessageItem` component to display messages.
-   [ ] Integrate API service to call the Next.js proxy.
-   [ ] Implement loading indicators during AI processing.
-   [ ] Implement basic error handling and display for API calls.
-   [ ] Ensure functionality within Expo Go on iOS.

### Phase 3: Next.js API Proxy (Backend)
-   [ ] Create `/api/chat` endpoint in Next.js.
-   [ ] Implement secure proxy logic to call Google Gemini API.
    -   [ ] Manage API key via environment variables.
    -   [ ] Ensure request/response structures are defined.
-   [ ] Basic error handling for Gemini API calls.
-   [ ] Deploy initial version to Vercel/Railway for testing.

### Phase 4: Language Toggle & Localization (React Native App)
-   [ ] Integrate i18next with React Native app.
-   [ ] Create initial translation files (`/src/locales/en.json`, `/src/locales/th.json`) for UI elements.
-   [ ] Implement UI component for language switching.
-   [ ] Ensure UI text updates correctly based on selected language.
-   [ ] Test thoroughly in Expo Go.

### Phase 5: UX Feedback (React Native App)
-   [ ] Add thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons to `MessageItem` for AI responses.
-   [ ] Implement logic to capture feedback (initially, this might just be a console log or simple state update; backend storage is post-MVP).
-   [ ] Implement a "Retry" mechanism for failed message sends or unsatisfactory AI responses.
-   [ ] Refine error messages to be user-friendly and localized.

### Phase 6: Testing, Refinement & Deployment Prep
-   [ ] Comprehensive testing in Expo Go on iOS.
-   [ ] Address any compatibility issues or bugs.
-   [ ] Code review and cleanup.
-   [ ] Prepare for EAS Build (if applicable for a more formal TestFlight release).

## Known Issues (As of Initialization)
-   None. Project is at the very beginning.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   *(This section will track significant changes or pivots from the initial plan as development progresses.)*
-   **2025-05-09:** Project initiated. Decision to use React Native (Expo Bare) and Next.js for API proxy confirmed based on project brief and `.clinerules`. Focus on Expo Go compatibility established as a primary driver.
