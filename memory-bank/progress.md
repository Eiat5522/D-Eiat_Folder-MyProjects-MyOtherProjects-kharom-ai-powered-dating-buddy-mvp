# Project Progress

## Current Status: AI Provider Switched to OpenRouter
- **Overall:** KhaRom MVP Phase 0 & 1 complete. Phase 2 (Core Chat UI & Logic) is largely complete. AI Provider switched from Google Gemini to OpenRouter.
- **`mobile-app` successfully upgraded to Expo SDK 53.**
- **`react-native-safe-area-context` successfully integrated.**
- **Core chat flow (send message, display user message, call API, display AI message, loading/error states, feedback icons) is functional in Expo Go (pending backend test with OpenRouter).**
- **Task 2.1 (Chat Screen UI), Task 2.2 (MessageBubble feedback icons), Task 2.3 (API Integration), and Task 2.4 (Basic Loading/Error States) are complete.**
- **OpenRouter integration in `api-server` complete (code changes).**

## What Works
-   **Project Definition:** Clear understanding of MVP scope, features, users, and constraints.
-   **Core Documentation:** Memory Bank and `cline_docs` established and updated (being updated for OpenRouter).
-   **Version Control:** Basic Git setup with initial project files pushed to GitHub.
-   **Mobile App Foundation (SDK 53):**
    -   The `mobile-app` (React Native Expo SDK 53) project is scaffolded and previewable in Expo Go.
    -   ESLint and Prettier configured.
    -   Core dependencies: `expo: "^53.0.0"`, `react: "19.0.0"`, `react-native: "0.79.2"`, `expo-status-bar: "^2.2.3"`.
    -   `react-native-safe-area-context` integrated and working.
    -   `react-native-svg` used for icons (though `package.json` update was problematic, it's functionally working).
    -   **Chat functionality:** Sending messages, displaying user/AI messages, API calls to backend, basic loading/error indicators, and feedback icons on AI messages are operational (will connect to OpenRouter backend).
-   **API Server Foundation (Updated for OpenRouter):**
    -   Next.js v15.3.2 project scaffolded with linting/formatting.
    -   Working `/api/chat` endpoint now integrated with OpenRouter using the OpenAI SDK.
    -   Environment variables for OpenRouter API key and default model configured.
    -   Comprehensive error handling and logging adapted for OpenRouter.
    -   Deployed to Vercel: `https://d-eiat-folder-my-projects-my-other-projects-eiat5522s-projects.vercel.app/api/chat` (This deployment will need to be updated with new env vars and code).

## Known Issues
-   **`mobile-app` (SDK 53):**
    -   Currently running with a minimal set of dependencies. Further dependencies need to be added and tested carefully.
    -   Original 3 low severity vulnerabilities from SDK 51 setup might still be present or new ones introduced with SDK 53; to be reviewed later.
-   **Expo Go Preview with iPhone Hotspot:** Potential connectivity issues persist if using the same iPhone for hotspot and Expo Go preview.
-   **Ngrok Tunneling:** Encountered `EPERM` errors with Ngrok when trying to use `--tunnel` with Expo CLI. Testing on local network is the current workaround.
-   **Vercel Deployment:** Needs to be updated with new OpenRouter environment variables and the latest code for `api-server`.
