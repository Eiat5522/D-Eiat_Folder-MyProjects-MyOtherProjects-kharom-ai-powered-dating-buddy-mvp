-   [ ] **Task 5.2:** Bug fixing and performance optimization.
-   [ ] **Task 5.3:** Code reviews.

## Known Issues
-   **`mobile-app`:** Contains 3 low severity vulnerabilities (deferred for MVP).
-   **Initial `mobile-app` setup:** Encountered issues with `expo-template-bare-typescript` (older SDK, critical vulnerabilities, Metro errors). Resolved by re-scaffolding with `blank-typescript@sdk-50`, prebuilding, and aligning dependencies to SDK 51.
-   **`api-server` Terminal Issues:** 
    - Difficulties with reliably starting and observing the Next.js development server within VS Code's integrated terminal
    - This impacts immediate testing of the Gemini API integration
    - Workarounds:
      1. Use external terminal for server testing
      2. Monitor server logs through Vercel/Railway once deployed
      3. Consider implementing additional logging mechanisms
