# Project Progress

## Current Status: Phase 2 Core Functionality Largely Complete
- **Overall:** KhaRom MVP Phase 0 & 1 complete. Phase 2 (Core Chat UI & Logic) is now largely complete.
- **`mobile-app` successfully upgraded to Expo SDK 53.**
- **`react-native-safe-area-context` successfully integrated.**
- **Core chat flow (send message, display user message, call API, display AI message, loading/error states, feedback icons) is functional in Expo Go.**
- **Task 2.1 (Chat Screen UI), Task 2.2 (MessageBubble feedback icons), Task 2.3 (API Integration), and Task 2.4 (Basic Loading/Error States) are complete.**

## What Works
-   **Project Definition:** Clear understanding of MVP scope, features, users, and constraints.
-   **Core Documentation:** Memory Bank and `cline_docs` established and updated.
-   **Version Control:** Basic Git setup with initial project files pushed to GitHub.
-   **Mobile App Foundation (SDK 53):**
    -   The `mobile-app` (React Native Expo SDK 53) project is scaffolded and previewable in Expo Go.
    -   ESLint and Prettier configured.
    -   Core dependencies: `expo: "^53.0.0"`, `react: "19.0.0"`, `react-native: "0.79.2"`, `expo-status-bar: "^2.2.3"`.
    -   `react-native-safe-area-context` integrated and working.
    -   `react-native-svg` used for icons (though `package.json` update was problematic, it's functionally working).
    -   **Chat functionality:** Sending messages, displaying user/AI messages, API calls to backend, basic loading/error indicators, and feedback icons on AI messages are operational.
-   **API Server Foundation:**
    -   Next.js v15.3.2 project scaffolded with linting/formatting.
    -   Working `/api/chat` endpoint with Gemini integration.
    -   Comprehensive error handling and logging.
    -   Content safety checks implemented.
    -   User-friendly error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.
    -   Deployed to Vercel: `https://d-eiat-folder-my-projects-my-other-projects-eiat5522s-projects.vercel.app/api/chat`.

## Known Issues
-   **`mobile-app` (SDK 53):**
    -   Currently running with a minimal set of dependencies. Further dependencies need to be added and tested carefully.
    -   Original 3 low severity vulnerabilities from SDK 51 setup might still be present or new ones introduced with SDK 53; to be reviewed later.
-   **Expo Go Preview with iPhone Hotspot:** Potential connectivity issues persist if using the same iPhone for hotspot and Expo Go preview.
-   **Ngrok Tunneling:** Encountered `EPERM` errors with Ngrok when trying to use `--tunnel` with Expo CLI. Testing on local network is the current workaround.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   **2025-05-09:**
    - Project initiated with `expo-template-bare-typescript` for `mobile-app`.
    - Encountered critical vulnerabilities and Metro bundler errors.
    - Re-scaffolded using `blank-typescript@sdk-50`, then aligned to SDK 51.
-   **2025-05-10 (Morning - Afternoon):**
    - Created `api-server` with Next.js v15.3.2.
    - Configured ESLint/Prettier for both projects.
    - Completed Phase 0 setup.
    - Completed Phase 1 (Backend API Proxy), including Gemini integration, error handling, and Vercel deployment.
-   **2025-05-10 (Evening):**
    - Started Phase 2, Task 2.1 (Basic Chat UI).
    - Encountered significant issues upgrading `mobile-app` from Expo SDK 51 to SDK 53.
    - **Successfully resolved SDK 53 upgrade issues** by:
        - Simplifying `App.tsx` and component imports.
        - Systematically cleaning `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, and npm cache.
        - Updating `package.json` with core SDK 53 compatible versions (`expo: "^53.0.0"`, `react: "19.0.0"`, `react-native: "0.79.2"`).
        - Updating `app.json` (`sdkVersion: "53.0.0"`) and `babel.config.js` to minimal working configurations.
        - Confirmed the app is previewable in Expo Go with this minimal SDK 53 setup.
    - **Integrated `react-native-safe-area-context`** into the SDK 53 `mobile-app` and verified in Expo Go.
    - **Decided to defer `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated`** (2025-05-10).
    - **Implemented core chat functionality (Tasks 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)** including API integration, message display, loading/error states, and feedback icons using SVGs (2025-05-10).
