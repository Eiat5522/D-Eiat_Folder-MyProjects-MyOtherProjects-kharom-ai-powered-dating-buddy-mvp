# Project Progress (As of 2025-05-11)

## Current Status: Implemented AI Language Bias Fallback
- **Overall:** KhaRom MVP Phase 0 & 1 complete. Phase 2 (Core Chat UI & Logic) is functionally complete. A two-step translation fallback has been implemented in `api-server` to address AI language bias.
- **Current Focus:** Testing the implemented two-step translation fallback mechanism. Previous attempts (strengthened system instruction, prompt wrapping, chat history priming) **failed**.
- **`mobile-app` successfully upgraded to Expo SDK 53.**
- **`react-native-safe-area-context` successfully integrated.**
- **Core chat flow (send message, display user message, call API, display AI message, loading/error states, feedback icons) is functional in Expo Go (pending resolution of language bias).**
- **Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 are complete.**
- **Git `main` branch updated with `sdk-53-upgrade` changes and initial system prompt.**

## What Works
-   **Project Definition:** Clear understanding of MVP scope, features, users, and constraints.
-   **Core Documentation:** Memory Bank and `cline_docs` established (being updated to reflect current investigation).
-   **Version Control:** Git setup on GitHub, `main` branch reflects latest stable version.
-   **Mobile App Foundation (SDK 53):**
    -   The `mobile-app` (React Native Expo SDK 53) project is scaffolded and previewable in Expo Go.
    -   ESLint and Prettier configured.
    -   Core dependencies for chat UI and API communication are integrated.
    -   **Chat functionality:** Sending messages, displaying user/AI messages, API calls to backend, basic loading/error indicators, and feedback icons on AI messages are operational.
-   **API Server Foundation:**
    -   Next.js v15.3.2 project (`api-server/`) is stable and deployed.
    -   Working `/api/chat` endpoint with Gemini integration.
    -   Comprehensive error handling and logging.
    -   Content safety checks implemented.
    -   Deployed to Vercel: `https://d-eiat-folder-my-projects-my-other-projects-eiat5522s-projects.vercel.app/api/chat`.
