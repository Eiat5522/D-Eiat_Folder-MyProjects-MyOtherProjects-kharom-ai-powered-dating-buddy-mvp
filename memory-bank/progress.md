# Project Progress

## Current Status: AI Provider Switched to OpenRouter, Initial Testing Done
- **Overall:** KhaRom MVP Phase 0 & 1 complete. Phase 2 (Core Chat UI & Logic) is largely complete. AI Provider switched from Google Gemini to OpenRouter. Tailwind CSS issues in `api-server` resolved. Playwright tests removed.
- **`mobile-app` successfully upgraded to Expo SDK 53.**
- **`react-native-safe-area-context` successfully integrated.**
- **Core chat flow (send message, display user message, call API, display AI message, loading/error states, feedback icons) is functional in Expo Go; **full testing with OpenRouter backend successful after resolving API key configuration issue.**
- **Task 2.1 (Chat Screen UI), Task 2.2 (MessageBubble feedback icons), Task 2.3 (API Integration), and Task 2.4 (Basic Loading/Error States) are complete.**
- **OpenRouter integration in `api-server` complete (code changes and system prompt for "Thai Dating Guru").**
- **Manual `curl` testing of the OpenRouter API endpoint is successful.**

## What Works
-   **Project Definition:** Clear understanding of MVP scope, features, users, and constraints.
-   **Core Documentation:** Memory Bank and `cline_docs` established and updated for OpenRouter migration and Playwright removal.
-   **Version Control:** Git setup with all recent changes pushed to GitHub.
-   **Mobile App Foundation (SDK 53):**
    -   The `mobile-app` (React Native Expo SDK 53) project is scaffolded and previewable in Expo Go.
    -   ESLint and Prettier configured.
    -   Core dependencies installed.
    -   **Chat functionality:** Core UI and logic for sending/receiving messages, loading/error states, and feedback icons are operational (will connect to OpenRouter backend).
-   **API Server Foundation (Updated for OpenRouter):**
    -   Next.js v15.3.2 project with working OpenRouter integration via OpenAI SDK.
    -   "Thai Dating Guru" system prompt implemented.
    -   Environment variables for OpenRouter API key and default model (`mistralai/mistral-small-24b-instruct-2501`) configured.
    -   Comprehensive error handling and logging.
    -   Tailwind CSS configuration fixed.
-   Deployed to Vercel: `https://d-eiat-folder-my-projects-my-other-projects-eiat5522s-projects.vercel.app/api/chat`. Manual `curl` tests confirm it responds in Thai. **Full mobile app integration testing via Expo Go is now successful.**

## Known Issues
-   **`mobile-app` (SDK 53):**
    -   Currently running with a minimal set of dependencies. Further dependencies need to be added and tested carefully.
    -   Original 3 low severity vulnerabilities from SDK 51 setup might still be present or new ones introduced with SDK 53; to be reviewed later.
-   **Expo Go Preview with iPhone Hotspot:** Potential connectivity issues persist if using the same iPhone for hotspot and Expo Go preview.
-   **Ngrok Tunneling:** Encountered `EPERM` errors with Ngrok when trying to use `--tunnel` with Expo CLI. Testing on local network is the current workaround.
-   **Vercel Deployment:** API server is deployed. Full mobile app integration testing successful.
