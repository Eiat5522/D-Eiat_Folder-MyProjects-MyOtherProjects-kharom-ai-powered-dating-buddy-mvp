# Project Progress

## Current Status: Project Setup In Progress (As of 2025-05-09)
- **Overall:** KhaRom MVP project initialization phase ongoing.
- **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files created and updated.
- **Knowledge Graph:** Initialized with core entities and relationships.
- **Git Repository:** Local Git repo initialized, initial docs committed. Remote GitHub repository linked. `README.md` created and pushed.
- **Mobile App (`mobile-app`):**
    - React Native (Expo SDK 51) project structure created using `blank-typescript@sdk-50` template, then `expo prebuild --clean`.
    - Dependencies aligned to SDK 51, resulting in 3 low severity vulnerabilities (deferred).
    - Metro bundler (`npm start`) is confirmed working.
- **Next.js API Backend:** Not yet started.

## What Works
-   **Project Definition:** Clear understanding of MVP scope, features, users, and constraints.
-   **Core Documentation:** Memory Bank and `cline_docs` established and reflect current project state.
-   **Version Control:** Basic Git setup with initial project files pushed to GitHub.
-   **Mobile App Foundation:** The `mobile-app` (React Native Expo SDK 51) project is scaffolded, dependencies are installed, and the development server (`expo start`) runs successfully.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level MVP Goals)

### Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Ongoing)
-   [x] Initialize Git repository on GitHub. (Includes initial commit of docs & README)
-   [x] Initialize Knowledge Graph with core entities.
-   [x] Set up React Native (Expo Bare SDK 51) project structure (`mobile-app`).
    -   [x] Successfully scaffolded and Metro bundler is operational.
    -   [ ] Commit current stable `mobile-app` state to Git.
-   [ ] Set up Next.js API project structure (`api-server` or similar).
-   [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier for both projects.

### Phase 2: Core Chat Functionality (React Native App)
-   [ ] Implement basic UI for Chat Screen (Message Input, Message List).
-   [ ] Develop `MessageItem` component to display messages.
-   [ ] Integrate API service to call the Next.js proxy.
-   [ ] Implement loading indicators during AI processing.
-   [ ] Implement basic error handling and display for API calls.
-   [ ] Ensure functionality within Expo Go on iOS.

### Phase 3: Next.js API Proxy (Backend)
-   [ ] Create `/api/chat` endpoint in Next.js.
-   [ ] Implement secure proxy logic to call Google Gemini API.
    -   [ ] Manage API key via environment variables.
    -   [ ] Ensure request/response structures are defined.
-   [ ] Basic error handling for Gemini API calls.
-   [ ] Deploy initial version to Vercel/Railway for testing.

### Phase 4: Language Toggle & Localization (React Native App)
-   [ ] Integrate i18next with React Native app.
-   [ ] Create initial translation files (`/src/locales/en.json`, `/src/locales/th.json`) for UI elements.
-   [ ] Implement UI component for language switching.
-   [ ] Ensure UI text updates correctly based on selected language.
-   [ ] Test thoroughly in Expo Go.

### Phase 5: UX Feedback (React Native App)
-   [ ] Add thumbs-up/thumbs-down buttons to `MessageItem` for AI responses.
-   [ ] Implement logic to capture feedback (initially, this might just be a console log or simple state update; backend storage is post-MVP).
-   [ ] Implement a "Retry" mechanism for failed message sends or unsatisfactory AI responses.
-   [ ] Refine error messages to be user-friendly and localized.

### Phase 6: Testing, Refinement & Deployment Prep
-   [ ] Comprehensive testing in Expo Go on iOS.
-   [ ] Address any compatibility issues or bugs.
-   [ ] Code review and cleanup.
-   [ ] Prepare for EAS Build (if applicable for a more formal TestFlight release).

## Known Issues
-   **`mobile-app`:** Contains 3 low severity vulnerabilities (deferred for MVP).
-   **Initial `mobile-app` setup:** Encountered issues with `expo-template-bare-typescript` (older SDK, critical vulnerabilities, Metro errors). Resolved by re-scaffolding with `blank-typescript@sdk-50`, prebuilding, and aligning dependencies to SDK 51.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
-   *(This section will track significant changes or pivots from the initial plan as development progresses.)*
-   **2025-05-09:** Project initiated. Initial plan to use `expo-template-bare-typescript` for `mobile-app`.
-   **2025-05-09:** Encountered critical vulnerabilities and Metro bundler errors with the initial `mobile-app` setup (based on an older Expo SDK).
-   **2025-05-09:** Decision made to re-scaffold `mobile-app` using `blank-typescript@sdk-50` template, then `expo prebuild`, and align dependencies to Expo SDK 51. This resolved critical vulnerabilities (leaving 3 low) and fixed the Metro bundler error.
