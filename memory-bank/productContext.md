## Why KhaRom Exists
KhaRom aims to address the challenges Thai-speaking singles face in initiating and maintaining engaging conversations in dating scenarios. Crafting messages that are confident, culturally appropriate, and effective can be difficult. KhaRom provides a supportive tool to overcome these hurdles.
