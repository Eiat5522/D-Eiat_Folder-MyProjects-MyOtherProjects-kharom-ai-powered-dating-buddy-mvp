# Current Task: Setup Project Repositories & Structure (Phase 0 - Task 0.3)

## Current Objective
Continue with **Task 0.3** from `projectRoadmap.md`: Setup Project Repositories & Structure.
The React Native (Expo SDK 51) project `mobile-app` has been successfully set up and verified to be runnable (Metro bundler starts, QR code visible). It has 3 low severity vulnerabilities.
The next sub-task is: "Set up Next.js API project structure."

## Context
-   **Overall Project:** KhaRom MVP development.
-   **Current Phase:** Phase 0: Project Initialization & Setup.
-   **Previous Step:**
    -   `mobile-app` directory re-created and dependencies aligned to Expo SDK 51.
    -   `npm start` confirmed working for `mobile-app`.
    -   Task 0.3.2 "Set up React Native (Expo Bare) project structure" is now considered complete and stable.
-   **Relevant Document:** `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` (Task 0.3).

## Action Item for User: Commit All Project Setup Changes
Before we set up the Next.js project, please commit all recent changes (stable `mobile-app` and updated documentation) to your Git repository:
1.  Open your terminal in the project root: `d:/Eiat_Folder/MyProjects/MyOtherProjects/kharom-ai-powered-dating-buddy-mvp`
2.  Execute the following commands:
    ```bash
    git add mobile-app/ cline_docs/ memory-bank/ README.md
    git commit -m "feat: Setup mobile-app (Expo SDK 51), update all documentation"
    git push origin main
    ```
    *(This commit includes the stable `mobile-app` structure, updated `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and all revised `cline_docs` and `memory-bank` files.)*

Please confirm once this is done.

## Next Steps for Task 0.3 (after this commit)
1.  **Next.js API Project Setup:**
    *   Provide commands to initialize a new Next.js project (e.g., in `api-server` or `backend`).
    *   Guide on initial project structure (`/src/app/api` as per `.clinerules`).
    *   Mark "Set up Next.js API project structure" as complete in `projectRoadmap.md`.
    *   Instruct user to commit the new Next.js project directory.
2.  **Linters & Formatters:**
    *   Provide guidance for setting up ESLint and Prettier in both `mobile-app` and the Next.js project.
    *   Mark "Configure ESLint and Prettier for both projects" as complete.
    *   Instruct user to commit configurations.
3.  Once all sub-tasks for Task 0.3 are done, update `projectRoadmap.md` to mark Task 0.3 as fully complete.
4.  Proceed to **Phase 1: Backend API Proxy (Next.js)**.
