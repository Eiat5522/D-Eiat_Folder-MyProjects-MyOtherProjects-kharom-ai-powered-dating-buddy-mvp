# Current Task: Phase C (Session-Based Chat History) Implementation Complete - Entering Phase 5 (Testing & Refinement)

## Current Objective
The implementation of the Session-Based Chat History feature (Phase C) for the KhaRom MVP is complete. The project is now moving into Phase 5: Testing & Refinement of all implemented features.

## Context
-   **Overall Project:** KhaRom MVP development.
-   **Previous Task Focus:** Implementation of Session-Based Chat History (Phases C.1 to C.6). This included data storage, session context management, UI for history screen with swipe actions, drawer integration, ChatScreen modifications, and localization.

## Changes Implemented (Chat History - 2025-05-11)
-   **Data Structure & Storage (Phase C.1):**
    -   Defined `ChatSession` and `SessionSummary` interfaces in `ChatApiService.ts`.
    -   Created `SessionStorageService.ts` with functions (`getAllSessionSummaries`, `getChatSession`, `saveChatSession`, `deleteChatSession`, `updateSessionTitle`, `createNewSessionObject`) using `AsyncStorage`.
-   **Session Management Logic (Phase C.2):**
    -   Created `SessionContext.tsx` with `SessionProvider` and `useSession` hook.
    -   Implemented context functions: `loadSessionSummaries`, `selectSession`, `createNewSession`, `saveMessageToActiveSession`, `renameSession`, `deleteSession`, `updateMessageFeedbackInActiveSession`, `refreshSessionSummaries`.
    -   Integrated `SessionProvider` into `App.tsx`.
-   **UI - Chat History Screen (Phase C.3):**
    -   Created `ChatHistoryScreen.tsx`.
    -   Displays list of sessions, handles loading and empty states.
    -   Items are pressable to select a session.
    -   Implemented swipe-to-reveal "Rename" and "Delete" actions using `ReanimatedSwipeable`.
    -   Rename uses `Alert.prompt`; Delete uses `Alert.alert` for confirmation.
    -   Added a FAB for "New Chat".
-   **UI - Drawer Integration (Phase C.4):**
    -   Added "Chat History" screen to `AppNavigator.tsx`.
    -   Added "New Chat" item to `CustomDrawerContent` in `AppNavigator.tsx`.
-   **`ChatScreen.tsx` Modifications (Phase C.5):**
    -   Refactored to use `SessionContext` for displaying messages (`activeSessionMessages`) and saving new messages (`saveMessageToActiveSession`).
    -   Handles initial load by creating a new session if none is active.
    -   `handleFeedback` now uses `updateMessageFeedbackInActiveSession` from context.
-   **Localization (Phase C.6):**
    -   Added new translation keys for chat history features to `en.json` and `th.json`.
-   **Documentation Updated:**
    -   `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` updated to include Phase C and mark tasks as complete.
    -   This file (`cline_docs/currentTask.md`).

## Next Steps
1.  **User Testing (Phase 5.1):** User to comprehensively test all features, with a strong focus on the new Chat History functionality:
    -   Creating new chat sessions (via FAB and Drawer).
    -   Loading existing sessions from history.
    -   Continuing conversations in loaded sessions.
    -   Renaming sessions.
    -   Deleting sessions (with confirmation).
    -   Swipe actions on history items.
    -   Correct display of session titles, timestamps, snippets.
    -   Empty state and loading state for history.
    -   Persistence of sessions and messages across app restarts.
    -   Interaction with existing features (language toggle, message feedback) within the context of sessions.
2.  **Bug Fixing & UI Polish (Phase 5.2):** Address any bugs or UI/UX inconsistencies identified during user testing.
3.  **Code Reviews (Phase 5.3):** Conduct code reviews for all new and modified components related to chat history.
4.  **Expo Go Compatibility (Phase 5.4):** Continue to ensure all features work smoothly in Expo Go.
5.  **Update Remaining Documentation:** `memory-bank/*` files and `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   Chat history is stored locally using `AsyncStorage`. Performance with a very large number of sessions/messages might be a future consideration but is acceptable for MVP.
-   Session titles are currently "New Chat [timestamp]"; future enhancement could derive titles from message content.
-   The `handleFeedback` mechanism in `ChatScreen.tsx` now correctly persists feedback to the active session.
-   Ensure all new UI strings related to chat history are correctly translated and displayed in both English and Thai.
