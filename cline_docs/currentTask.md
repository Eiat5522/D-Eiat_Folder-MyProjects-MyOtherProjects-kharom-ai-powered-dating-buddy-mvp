# Current Task: Setup Project Repositories & Structure (Phase 0 - Task 0.3)

## Current Objective
Continue with **Task 0.3** from `projectRoadmap.md`: Setup Project Repositories & Structure.
The React Native (Expo) project `mobile-app` has been set up (initially SDK 50, then `npm audit fix --force` applied). All reported vulnerabilities are now resolved. The stability of the project after forced updates needs to be verified.
The next sub-task is: "Set up Next.js API project structure."

## Context
-   **Overall Project:** KhaRom MVP development.
-   **Current Phase:** Phase 0: Project Initialization & Setup.
-   **Previous Step:**
    -   `mobile-app` directory re-created using Expo SDK 50 (`blank-typescript@sdk-50` template).
    -   `npx expo prebuild --clean` run to generate native folders.
    -   `npm audit fix --force` run; 0 vulnerabilities now reported. Core dependencies like `expo` were updated to `53.0.9`.
    -   Task 0.3.2 "Set up React Native (Expo Bare) project structure" marked complete in `projectRoadmap.md` (pending stability verification).
-   **Relevant Document:** `cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md` (Task 0.3).

## Action Item for User: Commit `mobile-app` Changes & Test Stability
Before we proceed to set up the Next.js project, please:
1.  **Commit the changes** in the `mobile-app` directory (updated `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, potentially other files changed by `npm audit fix --force` and `expo prebuild`) to your Git repository:
    ```bash
    git add mobile-app/
    git commit -m "feat: Setup Expo SDK 50 mobile-app, apply npm audit fix --force (0 vulnerabilities)"
    git push origin main
    ```
2.  **Test `mobile-app` Stability (Crucial):**
    Try to run the application to ensure it wasn't broken by the forced updates. In the `d:/Eiat_Folder/MyProjects/MyOtherProjects/kharom-ai-powered-dating-buddy-mvp/mobile-app` directory, run:
    ```bash
    npm start 
    # Then try to open on Expo Go (iOS) or an emulator/simulator.
    # Or directly:
    # npm run ios
    # npm run android
    ```
    Please report if it builds and runs without major errors. If it's broken, we may need to revisit the `mobile-app` setup.

Please confirm the commit/push and the basic stability of `mobile-app`.

## Next Steps for Task 0.3 (after `mobile-app` commit & stability check)
1.  **Next.js API Project Setup:**
    *   Provide commands to initialize a new Next.js project (e.g., in `api-server` or `backend`).
    *   Guide on initial project structure (`/src/app/api`).
    *   Mark "Set up Next.js API project structure" as complete.
    *   Instruct user to commit the new Next.js project directory.
2.  **Linters & Formatters:**
    *   Provide guidance for setting up ESLint and Prettier in both projects.
    *   Mark "Configure ESLint and Prettier for both projects" as complete.
    *   Instruct user to commit configurations.
3.  Once all sub-tasks for Task 0.3 are done, update `projectRoadmap.md` to mark Task 0.3 as fully complete.
4.  Proceed to **Phase 1: Backend API Proxy (Next.js)**.
