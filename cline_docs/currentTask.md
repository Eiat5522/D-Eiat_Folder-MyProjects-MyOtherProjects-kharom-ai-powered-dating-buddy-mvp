# Current Task: AI Provider Switched to OpenRouter

## Current Objective
The AI provider for the backend API has been successfully switched from Google Gemini to OpenRouter, and this integration is now fully tested and functional with the mobile app. An API key configuration issue encountered during testing has been resolved.

## Context
-   **Overall Project:** KhaRom MVP development.
-   **Previous Task Focus:** Phase 3 (Localization) and Phase 4 (UX Feedback) were next. This OpenRouter migration was an ad-hoc request.
-   **Previous AI Provider:** Google Gemini.
-   **New AI Provider:** OpenRouter, accessed via the OpenAI SDK.

## Changes Implemented (2025-05-11)
-   **API Server (`api-server/`) Updated:**
    -   `api-server/.env.local` created with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL` placeholders.
    -   `openai` SDK installed.
    -   `api-server/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` modified:
        -   Replaced Google Gemini SDK with OpenAI SDK configured for OpenRouter.
        -   Updated request handling to transform `prompt` to `messages` array.
        -   Adapted response parsing and error handling for OpenRouter/OpenAI SDK.
-   **Documentation Updated:**
    -   `cline_docs/techStack.md`
    -   `memory-bank/techContext.md`
    -   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
    -   `memory-bank/progress.md` (new "Phase X" added for this task)
    -   `cline_docs/codebaseSummary.md`
    -   This file (`cline_docs/currentTask.md`).

## Next Steps (API Migration Task Completed)
1.  **OpenRouter Integration Confirmed:** The OpenRouter backend is now working correctly with the mobile app.
2.  **Resume Planned Tasks or Address New Requests:** We can now:
    *   Proceed with **Phase 3: Localization (Task 3.1: Integrate i18next)**.
    *   Or proceed with **Phase 4: UX Feedback Mechanisms**.
    *   Or address other user requests, such as the training data scraping task.
3.  **Documentation Updated:** `memory-bank/progress.md` and `memory-bank/activeContext.md` will be updated to reflect these changes.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
-   The mobile app's `GeminiApiService.ts` was not changed in this step; the backend handles the adaptation. Consider renaming this service if it becomes confusing.
-   The default OpenRouter model is set via `OPENROUTER_DEFAULT_MODEL`. For more flexible model testing, the API could be enhanced to accept a model choice from the client.
