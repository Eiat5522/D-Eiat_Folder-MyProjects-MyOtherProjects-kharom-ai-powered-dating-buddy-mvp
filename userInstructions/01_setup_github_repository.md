# Instructions: Setting Up Your GitHub Repository for KhaRom

Follow these steps to initialize your local Git repository, create a new repository on GitHub, link them, and push your initial project files.

## Step 1: Initialize Local Git Repository & Make Initial Commit

Open your terminal in the project root directory: `d:/Eiat_Folder/MyProjects/MyOtherProjects/kharom-ai-powered-dating-buddy-mvp`

Execute the following commands one by one:

1.  **Initialize Git:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add existing project files to staging:**
    ```bash
    git add cline_docs/ memory-bank/ .clinerules/
    ```
    *(Note: Including `.clinerules/` as it contains project configuration)*

3.  **Commit the files:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Add Memory Bank, Cline Docs, and Cline Rules"
    ```

4.  **Optional: Rename the default branch to `main` (if it's not already, common practice):**
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

## Step 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in.
2.  Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3.  **Repository name:** Choose a name (e.g., `kharom-ai-powered-dating-buddy-mvp` or `KhaRom-App`).
4.  **Description (Optional):** Add a brief description of the project.
5.  **Public or Private:** Choose according to your preference.
6.  **IMPORTANT:** Do **NOT** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license yet. We will push the existing local repository.
7.  Click **"Create repository"**.

## Step 3: Link Local Repository to GitHub Remote & Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, you will see a page with instructions. Look for the section titled "...or push an existing repository from the command line".

Copy the commands provided by GitHub. They will look similar to this (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and the repository name you chose):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

Execute these two commands in your terminal (in the project root directory).

## Step 4: Verify
Refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see the `cline_docs/`, `memory-bank/`, and `.clinerules/` directories and their contents.
